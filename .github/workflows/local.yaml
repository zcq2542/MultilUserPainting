# Every github action needs at least one job.

jobs:
  build_and_test: # This is the name of our job, and you will see it in the 'Actions' tab.
    # We can have our integration tests run on multiple operating systems in 'containers'
    # that are hosted on github. You can create your own as well, or setup a 'container'
    # using a tool like docker if you like. For now, I am going to show you the ubuntu setup.
    # Available environments are here: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments
