# Planning

The first stage we learned in the software development life cycle is planning. 

1. Take a moment to look through all of the [milestones](./../) and again review the Statement of Work. 
2. Come up with a timeline for completing each of the milestones and post it here.
	- Your Project manager will look through this when completing the first milestone check-in to ensure you have a plan.
3. I also recommend at this time that you set up a channel to communicate with your team members (e.g. teams, slack, email, etc.).

**Fair Warning** Requirements and client needs are subject to change, so do the best you can to plan!

*TODO Add your estimated project timeline here highlighting major milestone completion targets*

*I recommend you use a markdown table or list to stay organized, add or remove as many entries as you need.*
